Steganography Project: Hiding Secrets in Digital Images
AICTE Edunet Foundation Cyber Security IBM Program

Introduction
Steganography is the art and science of hiding information within digital media, such as images, without drawing suspicion. This project, developed as part of the AICTE Edunet Foundation Cyber Security IBM Program, demonstrates how to conceal and extract secret messages using steganography techniques. It is designed to be a beginner-friendly yet professional tool for students and enthusiasts interested in cybersecurity and data hiding.

Key Features
Text Hiding in Images: Conceal secret messages within digital images.

Message Extraction: Decode hidden messages from encoded images.

Multi-Format Support: Works with popular image formats like JPEG, PNG, and BMP.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line tools for encoding and decoding.

Secure Encryption: Uses cryptographic techniques to protect hidden messages.

Technologies Used
This project leverages the following technologies:

Python: Core programming language for implementation.

OpenCV (cv2): For image processing and manipulation.

NumPy: For efficient numerical operations on image data.

Pillow (PIL): For handling and saving images in various formats.

Cryptography Library: To encrypt and decrypt messages for added security.
