# AICTE_Edunet-foundation-Cyber_security-IBM-Stegnography_project

This repository contains the code and resources for a Steganography project developed as part of the AICTE Edunet Foundation Cyber Security program, in collaboration with IBM.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing various Steganography techniques to hide secret messages within digital media (images, audio, or text). The goal is to understand the principles of Steganography, its applications in cyber security, and to develop practical skills in implementing these techniques.
